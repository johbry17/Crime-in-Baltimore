Learning objectives (paraphrased, based on bootcamp spot):
    learn how to use git to branch / merge / pull requests / etc.
    make sweet presentation with slides (Google Slides? - I don't have Microsoft Office)
    hypothesis testing / null hypothesis / common stat tests (with scipy.stats):
        aggregation
        correlation
        comparison
        summary statistics
        sentiment analysis
        time series analysis
        ANOVA

-------------------------------------------------

Planning phase 1

setup Git Project to track tasks (recommended)

create milestones and due dates (e.g.):
    ideation
    fetch data / API
    data analysis
    testing
    creating documentation
    create presentation

-------------------------------------------------

Planning phase 2

project proposal:
    kind of data / field of interest
    questions to ask
    possible data sources
    !!! check for copyright / fair use !!!

-------------------------------------------------

Actual Project
    -------------------------
extract data

?maybe merge some data?

clean the data - make it easy - change timestamp and relabel columns, maybe drop some outliers

!!! document data exploration and cleanup in a Jupyter Notebook

prep for analysis

!!! document data analysis in a separate jupyter notebook

create plots, 6-8 visuals, at least two per question

(I say we just run through as many of the above scipy.stats as we can, then cherry-pick our 6-8)

-------------------------------------------------

Presentation

7-minute presentation, 3-minute Q & A 

6-8 visuals, 2 per question

executive summary, including how project relates to industry

overview of extract-transform-load-exploration and data source - !!why!! this data source

group approach to problem / relevant code / live demos / insights / problems encountered

results / conclusions / images / examples / if incomplete, why did it fail?

next steps (future research)
